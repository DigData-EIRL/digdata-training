# DigData Training

In this repository we explain the practices and standards that we use in [DigData-EIRL](https://github.com/DigData-EIRL).

## Work on a project

1. Fork the project repository.
2. Create a new branch. You must create a branch for each ticket. Example: `hotfix/login` or `feature/new-feature`.
3. Make code changes.
4. Commit and push. Remember that the commit must be a description of the change. Example: `fix: Login`.
5. Make pull request from your branch to the `develop` branch of the main repository.
6. Wait for the change to be accepted.

## Considerations

- The commits must be well-written. Use the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification for each _commit_.
- Every change must be documented. Use the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) specification to document your _changes_.
- [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) is used to manage the _branches_.
